* Processor Modes
** Real mode
- 16-bit environment.
- Uses the native segment:offset memory model.
- Is limited to 1 MB (+64k) of memory.
- No Virtual Memory or Memory Protection.
** Protected mode
- 32-bit environment.
- Memory protection through *Descriptor Table*.
- No more direct memory accessing. Any memory access must be done through the
  use of *Descriptor Table*.
- Can accesss up to 4GB RAM.
- Virtual memory available.
* BIOS interrupt services
** How to use
- BIOS provides basic subroutines for hardware manipulation i.e. read from a flobby
  disk or write text on screen.

- To call these subroutines, simply put the arguments on appropriate registers
  (specified by the documentation of each subroutine), and call instruction
  =int= on appropriate interrupt number provided by a BIOS.

- At this stage, the BIOS interrupt service routines are the only available
  interrupts for a software to use. Using any undefined interrupt number causing
  the software to crash.

- BIOS subroutines are only available in real-mode. When switching to proctected
  mode, these subroutines are unavailable.

** Example 1: reading data from a flobby disk into memory

** Example 2: printing text on screen
* BIOS Paramater Block and the MBR
* Segment:Offset Addressing Mode
** History
- 16-bit CPU could address only 64 kB memory directly. Even at the time,
  programs need more than that.

- To challenge competitors, who were making 16-bit processors at the time that
  only access up to 64kB, Intel introduced this feature.

- *segment:offset* memory scheme was born.
** Segment
- A segment is a section of memory.
- Memory is divided into 64kB sections.
- Each section has a base address, which is a location in memory that starts a
  section. For example, section 1 starts at 0, section 2 starts at 65536...
** Offset
- An offset is a number that is added to base number to get the exact memory
  address to be accessed.

- For example, if the base address is 65536 and offset is 3, then the memory address
  to be accessed is 65536 + 3 = 65539.
