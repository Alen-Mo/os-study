1. Create a Makefile that compile all .nasm files in bootloader and kernel directories.
2. Create a build directory to store built binary files.
3. Create a flobby disk with 10 sectors.
4. Create a empty nasm file call =boot_loader.asm= in =bootloader/= directory.
   Compile the file.
5. Write the boot loader content on first sector
6. Run =bochs= command. Select entry =6= in the menu to start simulation.
7. Run =bochsdb= command. Selectr entry =6= in the menu to start debugging.
8. When the prompt stops at =<bochs:1>=, put a breakpiont at =0x7C00h= with the
   command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     <bochs:1> b 0x7C00
   #+END_SRC

9. Then, start executing with by enter the command =c=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     <bochs:2> c
   #+END_SRC

10. When Bochs stops at 0x7C00, start executing instruction by instruction with
    the ocmmand:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     <bochs:2> n
   #+END_SRC
